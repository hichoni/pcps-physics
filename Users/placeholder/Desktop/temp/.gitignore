apphosting.yaml # Typically, you might want to commit apphosting.yaml if it's consistent across environments.
                # However, if it contains project-specific IDs that shouldn't be in a generic template,
                # you might .gitignore it and configure it per environment or via CLI during setup.
                # For now, let's assume it's okay to commit as it defines the build/run for App Hosting.
                # If you have multiple Firebase projects (dev, prod) from the same codebase,
                # you might need different apphosting.yaml files or manage them outside of git.
