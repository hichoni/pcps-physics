# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.

runConfig:
  # To minimize costs, allow instances to scale down to 0 when there's no traffic.
  # For applications requiring faster cold starts, consider setting this to 1 or higher.
  minInstances: 0
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 3

# Environment variables available to the build and runtime environments.
# These will be populated from the Firebase console's App Hosting environment variable settings.
# It's CRITICAL to set these in the Firebase console for the deployed app to connect to Firebase services.
# Example (you'll set these in the console, not directly here if deploying via GitHub connected to App Hosting console):
# env:
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_API_KEY" # This value will come from the Firebase console
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_AUTH_DOMAIN"
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_PROJECT_ID"
#   - variable: NEXT_PROJECT_ID # For Genkit/AI features if needed separately by backend
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_PROJECT_ID" # Can often be the same as NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_STORAGE_BUCKET"
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_APP_ID"
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
#     value: "YOUR_CONSOLE_SET_MEASUREMENT_ID" # If you use Analytics

# If you were using secrets from Secret Manager, it would look like this:
# env:
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#     secret: projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/secrets/firebase-api-key/versions/latest
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
#     secret: projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/secrets/firebase-auth-domain/versions/latest
#   # ... and so on for other variables
